# Address Autocomplete Extension - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Solution Overview

This implementation provides **address autocomplete functionality for customer profile pages**, including the challenging "Add Address" popup form. The solution uses a **Theme App Extension** with smart JavaScript that detects and enhances forms dynamically.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

✅ **Popup Detection** - Automatically detects when address forms appear (including popups/modals)
✅ **Universal Compatibility** - Works across different Shopify themes
✅ **Real-time Autocomplete** - Shows suggestions as users type
✅ **Smart Form Filling** - Auto-populates all address fields (city, state, zip)
✅ **Usage Tracking** - Tracks every API call for future billing
✅ **Admin Configuration** - Easy setup through Shopify admin panel

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. Popup Detection System**

The JavaScript uses **MutationObserver** to watch for DOM changes:

```javascript
// Watches for new elements being added to the page
const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  // Detects when popup appears
  if (node.matches('dialog') || node.matches('[role="dialog"]')) {
    enhanceAddressForms();
  }
});
```

**Why this works for popups:**
- Runs continuously in the background
- Detects when Shopify's "Add Address" modal appears
- Immediately enhances the form before user starts typing

### **2. Address Field Detection**

Finds address inputs using multiple selectors:

```javascript
const selectors = [
  'input[name*="address1"]',
  'input[autocomplete="address-line1"]',
  'input[id*="address1"]',
  // ... more patterns
];
```

**Covers:**
- Native Shopify customer account forms
- Theme-specific variations
- Custom form implementations

### **3. API Flow**

```
User Types Address

JavaScript (debounced)
       ↓
/apps/address-autocomplete/search
       ↓
Backend API (tracks usage)

```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_address_autocomplete_tables
```

This creates:
- `SwiftcompleteSettings` table (API configuration)
- `AddressLookup` table (usage tracking)

### **Step 2: Deploy the Extension**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
shopify app dev
```

The extension will be available in the merchant's theme editor.

### **Step 3: Merchant Setup**

**For Merchants Using Your App:**

1. Install your app from Shopify App Store
2. Go to: **Apps → Your App → Address Autocomplete Settings**
3. Enter Swiftcomplete API Key
4. Enable "Profile & account pages"
5. Save settings

6. Go to: **Online Store → Themes → Customize**
7. Click **App Embeds** (bottom left)
8. Find "Address Autocomplete" and **toggle it ON**
9. Save theme

### **Step 4: Test It**

1. Go to your storefront (as logged-in customer)
2. Navigate to: **Account → Addresses**
3. Click **"Add new address"** (popup appears)
4. Start typing an address in the Address field
5. You should see autocomplete suggestions!

---

## 🔍 Testing the Popup Detection

To verify the popup detection works:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Navigate to customer account → addresses
4. Click "Add new address"

**You should see:**
```
[Address Autocomplete] Initializing...
[Address Autocomplete] DOM observer activated
[Address Autocomplete] Found 1 address inputs
[Address Autocomplete] Attaching to: <input>
[Address Autocomplete] Attached successfully
```

If you see these logs, the popup detection is working! 🎉

## 💡 Key Technical Solutions

### **Problem 1: Popup appears after page load**
**Solution:** MutationObserver watches for DOM changes continuously

### **Problem 2: Different themes use different selectors**
**Solution:** Multiple selector patterns to catch all variations

### **Problem 3: Need to track usage for billing**
**Solution:** Backend API logs every request to `AddressLookup` table

### **Problem 4: Form fields have different names**
**Solution:** Smart field mapping with fallbacks

```javascript
const fieldMappings = {
  city: ['city', 'address_city', 'locality'],
  state: ['province', 'state', 'region'],
  zip: ['zip', 'postal', 'postcode']
};
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### **Modify API Endpoint**

Edit: `extensions/address-autocomplete/assets/address-autocomplete.js`

```javascript
config.apiEndpoint = '/your-custom-endpoint';
```

### **Change Styling**

Edit: `extensions/address-autocomplete/assets/address-autocomplete.css`

Customize colors, animations, dark mode, etc.

### **Adjust Debounce Delay**

Edit: `address-autocomplete.js`

```javascript
config.debounceDelay = 500; // Wait 500ms before API call
```

---

## 🔌 Swiftcomplete API Integration

### **Current Setup (Placeholder)**

```typescript
// app/routes/api.address-autocomplete.search.tsx
const swiftcompleteUrl = `https://api.swiftcomplete.com/v1/addresses/autocomplete`;
```

### **To Connect Real Swiftcomplete API:**

1. Get API documentation from Swiftcomplete
2. Update the endpoint URL
3. Update request format to match their API
4. Update response parsing

**Example:**

```typescript
const response = await fetch(swiftcompleteUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${settings.apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: query,
    country: "US",
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();

// Transform to standard format
const results = data.addresses.map(addr => ({
  address: addr.street,
  city: addr.city,
  state: addr.state,
  zip: addr.postal_code,
  country: addr.country
}));
```

---

## 📊 Usage Tracking & Billing

Every API call is logged:

```typescript
await prisma.addressLookup.create({
  data: {
    shop: shop,
    query: query,
    resultCount: data.addresses.length,
    charged: false,
    chargeAmount: 0.03  // $0.03 per lookup
  }
});
```

**View Usage:**
- Go to: **Apps → Your App → Address Autocomplete Settings**
- See "Usage Statistics (Last 30 Days)"

**Future Billing Integration:**
- Add Shopify Billing API calls
- Create usage charges based on `AddressLookup` records
- Mark `charged: true` after billing

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Autocomplete not showing?**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify extension is enabled in Theme Editor → App Embeds
3. Check if settings are saved in admin
4. Ensure API key is valid

### **Popup not detected?**

1. Check if theme uses custom address modal
2. Add theme-specific selectors to `observeDOMForNewForms()`
3. Increase mutation observer delay

### **API calls failing?**

1. Check `SwiftcompleteSettings` has valid API key
2. Verify Swiftcomplete API endpoint is correct
3. Check CORS settings
4. Review server logs

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
- [ ] Get real Swiftcomplete API credentials
- [ ] Test with actual API
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

### **Future Enhancements:**
